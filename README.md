4. **Build and Run**: Use `File > Package Project > iOS` to build the IPA file, then deploy it using Xcode.

## Usage

1. **Launch the App**: Open the app on your Android or iOS device.
2. **Load 3D Models**: Use the UI to load different 3D models.
3. **Interact with Models**: Use gestures to rotate, scale, and move the models within the AR environment.
4. **Access Settings**: Navigate through the settings to customize the experience (e.g., adjusting AR parameters, changing model details).

## Troubleshooting
